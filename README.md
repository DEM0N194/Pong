# Pong
First project using the Chili Framework

Okay guys this isn't just the regular old Pong you know ... there is a twist to it ..  you can shoot bullets at eachother yay :D

and if you manage to hit the ball you will not only reflect it, but you will speed up the ball too...
As to what happens when you hit your enemy find out for yourself :P

	Controls:
			Start round - SPACE
		Left Paddle:
			Up - W
			Down - S
			Shoot - D
		Right Paddle
			Up - UpArrow
			Down - DownArrow
			Shoot - Left Arrow
			
      
There are tons of missing features ... for example the screboard :/ ... I'll try to implement it sometime
